I've recently started working with Generative AI and am using LangChain, Pandas, and FAISS.

The previous data scientist (I’m not a data scientist; I’m a developer) installed Anaconda and used these libraries. From what I see, if I can simply install and use these libraries with `pip`, why would I need Anaconda?

To me, it seems like Anaconda adds an extra layer of complexity. Can someone please explain the benefits of using Anaconda?
